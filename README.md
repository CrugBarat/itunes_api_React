# iTunes API

A basic list app built using:

**Programming Language**: JavaScript

**Web App Framework**: React

**Markup/Styling**: HTML5/CSS3

**Data**: [iTunes API](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/applemusicapi)

The app fetches data from a the iTunes API and displays the top 80 songs in UK. The data displayed includes: song artwork, artist, title, release date, price and song preview (all of which link to iTunes site, where the song can be purchased or added to a playlist).

This exercise was tasked to me by CodeClan, Glasgow where I studied towards a PDA Level 8 in Professional Software Development. The exercise brief can be found below.

# Brief

Make a simple React app that displays the current UK top 20 songs. You are required to use a stateless component as part of your app.

**MVP**

- Request the data, then display the list of songs with each song showing its chart position, title and artist

**Extensions**

- Add more information - you could include images or the preview song audio clips
- Style this nicely with CSS.

# Setup

- Download/Clone the repo

```
npm install
```
```
npm start
```
